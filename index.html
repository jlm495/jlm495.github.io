        <p>Hello, World!</p>
        <p> My name is Jenna Mandel</p>
        <p> I'm a junior, majoring in CTD & minoring in space & biomed. I know that
            sounds pretty random. I was originally majoring in Aerospace, but wanted
            something more hands-on. I enjoy motocross & pretty much anything outdoors.
            My parents own a salvage yard, which is how I got into engineering in the 
            first place. I'm originally from Colorado Springs. I'm really excited for 
            this class!

        <p>Currently, I am working towards getting my <abbr title="Bachelor of Science">BS</abbr> in Creative Technology & Design at <abbr title="University of Colorado at Boulder">CU Boulder</abbr>. I'm minoring in Biomedical Engineering and Space.
            I've been <abbr title="Teaching Assistant">TA</abbr>ing a total of 2 semesters now, and will be doing it again in Fall 2023. </p>
            
            <p>The first class I TA'd for was GEEN 2010: Engineering Tools & Analysis. In this class,
                I helped students with a wide range of engineering topics, including: building/diagnosing circuits; using tools such as multimeters and oscilloscopes; using software such as arduino, MATLab, and Microsoft Excel; learning/applying mathematical concepts
                involving Differential Equations, Calculus, Statics, Linear Algebra, and Physics.</p>

            <p>
                My second semester TAing was for GEEN 1400, a 1st-year engineering projects course. In this course, I helped students with more hands-on engineering ____ such as: CAD & 3D printing, laser-cutting, advanced Arduino & circuits, 
                writing technical reports, as well as general advising in regards to their projects and how to go about implementing their ideas.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am in the process of looking for internships for next semester. Ideally I'd like something hands-on, but I'd be open to a remote internship that mostly consists of coding as well.

        <h1 class="section-title" id="M">More About Me</h1>
        <img src="/img/dirtbike.JPG" alt="Jenna riding her dirt bike" id="dirtbike">

        <p>Throughout school I've always enjoyed math and science, but working at my family's salvage yard and dirt bike track is where I gained my love and appreciation for engineering. I originally enrolled at CU Boulder with
            the intention of majoring in Aerospace Engineering. When I made it into the program, I realized that I had lost a part of what drew me to engineering in the first place: creativity.
        </p>

        <p>My dream has always been to create,
            and the appeal for the prospect of engineering was exactly that: creating using math and science. While I found the curriculum to be fascinating, I felt that the projects lacked that creative thinking that I longed for.
            That's when I heard about the Atlas Institute at CU and fell in love instantly. Project-based curriculum built around creative freedom through engineering.</p>

        <p>Aside from engineering, my other passions include motocross, writing, and music.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title" id="F">Future</h1>

        <p>As for the future, I plan on graduating from school with my Bachelor's in May of 2025, and then going on to graduate school to get my Master's Degree.</p>
        <p>Career-wise, I would be happy as long as I get to do a job that's hands-on and mentally stimulating; anything that centers around creative problem-solving.</p>

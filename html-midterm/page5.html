    <h2>Changes Made:</h2>

    <h3>Page 1</h3>
    <hr>
    <ul>

        <li> fixed all the italices by closing the 'em' tag in line 81. It was missing a '/' & an 'm'</li>
        <li> replaced the spaces with underscores in attribute tag for link (line 56)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Page 2</h3>
    <hr>
    <ul>

        <li> fixed the bold tag for "New Beehive Inn" (line 26)</li>
        <li> fixed the link for 'bay'. Replaced the broken link with a wikipedia link (line 40)</li>
        <li> fixed the link for 'segmental arch', it had spaces so it was invalid, also it wasn't an actual link. I replaced it with a wikipedia link (line 57)</li>
        <li> the bold tag was on the outside of the heading tag instead of the inside for "Interior". I just deleted the bold tag since it's not necessary (line 52)</li>
        <li> changed "Interior" to heading 3 & added a horizontal line, so it would match "Description" (line 52 & 53)</li>
        <li> fixed the "History" line as well, changing the heading to heading 3 (line 74)</li>
        <li> added a line beneath "Closure" to match other sections (line 103)</li>

    </ul>

    <ul>

        <li> missing an 'i' in both ends of list tag (line 60)</li>

        <li> Zapata had a table heading tag instead of 'td' tag (line 88)</li>
        <li> moved Olatunkbo Chijiaku's age to the correct row. (line 99)</li>

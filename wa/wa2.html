    <p> My name is Jenna Mandel (she/her/hers). My goals for this course are to learn
        how to create a website & be comfortable using JS, CSS, & HTML. I consider myself
        a creative academic, because I love learning new things, but I also have found that
        I need a degree of creative freedom to be satisfied with my work. That's why the 
        Atlas program appealed to me so heavily.

            <b>Cygnus X-1</b> is a galactic X-ray source in the constellation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)">Cygnus</a> and was the first such source widely accepted to be a black hole. It was discovered in 1971 during a rocket flight and is one of the strongest X-ray 
            sources detectable from Earth, producing a peak X-ray flux density of 2.3×10<sup>−23</sup> W/(m2⋅Hz) (2.3×10<sup>3</sup> jansky).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-lewin_vanderklis2006-14">[14]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-usno2010-15">[15]</a></sup> It remains among the most studied astronomical objects in its class. The compact object is now estimated to have a mass about 21.2 
            times the mass of the Sun and has been shown to be too small to be any known kind of normal star or other likely object besides a black hole. If so, the radius of its event horizon has 300 km "as upper bound to the linear dimension of the 
            source region" of occasional X-ray bursts lasting only for about 1 ms.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-harko20060628-17">[17]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cygnus X-1 belongs to a high-mass X-ray binary system, located about 2.22 kiloparsecs from the Sun, that includes a blue supergiant variable star designated HDE 226868,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> which it orbits at about 0.2 AU, or 20% of the distance from Earth to the Sun. 
            A stellar wind from the star provides material for an accretion disk around the X-ray source. Matter in the inner disk is heated to millions of degrees, generating the observed X-rays. A pair of relativistic jets, arranged perpendicularly to 
            the disk, are carrying part of the energy of the infalling material away into interstellar space.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-mdsai76_600-23">[23]</a></sup>

        <p>
            Observation of X-ray emissions allows astronomers to study celestial phenomena involving gas with temperatures in the millions of degrees. However, because X-ray emissions are blocked by Earth's atmosphere, observation of celestial X-ray sources is not possible without lifting instruments to 
            altitudes where the X-rays can penetrate. Cygnus X-1 was discovered using X-ray instruments that were carried aloft by a sounding rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. As part of an ongoing effort to map these sources, a survey was conducted in 1964 using two 
            Aerobee suborbital rockets. The rockets carried Geiger counters to measure X-ray emission in wavelength range 1–15 <a href=""><abbr title="angstrom">Å</abbr></a> across an 8.4° section of the sky. These instruments swept across the sky as the rockets rotated, producing a map of closely spaced scans.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-science3656-11">[11]</a></sup>

        <p>

            As a result of these surveys, eight new sources of cosmic X-rays were discovered, including Cyg XR-1 (later Cyg X-1) in the constellation Cygnus. The celestial coordinates of this source were estimated as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension">right ascension</a> 19h53m and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination">declination</a> 34.6°. It was not associated with any especially 
            prominent radio or optical source at that position. 

        </p>
        <p>

            Seeing a need for longer-duration studies, in 1963 Riccardo Giacconi and Herb Gursky proposed the first orbital satellite to study X-ray sources. <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> launched their Uhuru satellite in 1970,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-heasarc20030626-28">[28]</a></sup> which led to the discovery of 300 new X-ray sources. Extended Uhuru observations of Cygnus X-1 showed 
            fluctuations in the X-ray intensity that occurs several times a second. This rapid variation meant that the energy generation must take place over a relatively small region of roughly 105 km, as the speed of light restricts communication between more distant regions. For a size comparison, 
            the diameter of the Sun is about 1.4×10<sup>6</sup> km.

            In April–May 1971, Luc Braes and George K. Miley from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_Observatory">Leiden Observatory</a>, and independently Robert M. Hjellming and Campbell Wade at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-apj168_L91-32">[32]</a></sup> detected radio emission from Cygnus X-1, and their accurate radio position pinpointed the X-ray source to the star AGK2 +35 
            1910 = HDE 226868. On the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere">celestial sphere</a>, this star lies about half a degree from the 4th-magnitude star Eta Cygni. It is a supergiant star that is by itself incapable of emitting the observed quantities of X-rays. Hence, the star must have a companion that could heat gas to the millions 
            of degrees needed to produce the radiation source for Cygnus X-1.

        </p>

        <p>

            Louise Webster and Paul Murdin, at the Royal Greenwich Observatory,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-nature235_2_37-36">[36]</a></sup> and Charles Thomas Bolton, working independently at the University of Toronto's David Dunlap Observatory,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-nature235_2_271-37">[37]</a></sup> announced the discovery of a massive hidden companion to HDE 226868 in 1972. Measurements of the Doppler shift of the star's 
            spectrum demonstrated the companion's presence and allowed its mass to be estimated from the orbital parameters. Based on the high predicted mass of the object, they surmised that it may be a black hole, as the largest possible neutron star cannot exceed three times the mass of the Sun.
        </p>

        <p>

            With further observations strengthening the evidence, by the end of 1973 the astronomical community generally conceded that Cygnus X-1 was most likely a black hole. More precise measurements of Cygnus X-1 demonstrated variability down to a single millisecond. This interval is consistent with turbulence 
            in a disk of accreted matter surrounding a black hole—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk">accretion disk</a>. X-ray bursts that last for about a third of a second match the expected time frame of matter falling toward a black hole.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-apj189_77-42">[42]</a></sup>

        </p>

        <p>

            Cygnus X-1 has since been studied extensively using observations by orbiting and ground-based instruments.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-SIMBAD-2">[2]</a></sup> The similarities between the emissions of X-ray binaries such as HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 and active galactic nuclei suggests a common mechanism of energy generation involving a black hole, an orbiting 
            accretion disk and associated jets. For this reason, Cygnus X-1 is identified among a class of objects called microquasars; an analog of the quasars, or quasi-stellar radio sources, now known to be distant active galactic nuclei. Scientific studies of binary systems such as HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 may lead 
            to further insights into the mechanics of active galaxies.

            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_object">compact object</a> and blue supergiant star form a binary system in which they orbit around their center of mass every 5.599829 days.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-aaa343_861-45">[45]</a></sup> From the perspective of Earth, the compact object never goes behind the other star; in other words, the system does not eclipse. However, the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight from Earth remains uncertain, with predictions ranging from 27°
             to 65°. A 2007 study estimated the inclination as 48.0±6.8°, which would mean that the semi-major axis is about 0.2 <abbr title="astronomical unit">AU</abbr>, or 20% of the distance from Earth to the Sun. The orbital eccentricity is thought to be only 0.018±0.002, meaning a nearly circular orbit.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-orosz2011-46">[46]</a></sup> Earth's distance to this system is about 1,860 ± 120 parsecs (6,070 ± 390 light-years).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-apj742_2-48">[48]</a></sup>

        <p>

            The HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 system shares a common motion through space with an association of massive stars named Cygnus OB3, which is located at roughly 2000 parsecs from the Sun. This implies that HDE 226868, Cygnus X-1 and this OB association may have formed at the same time and location. If so, then the age of the system is about 5±1.5 million years. The motion of HDE 226868 with respect to 
            Cygnus OB3 is 9±3 km/s, a typical value for random motion within a stellar association. HDE 226868 is about 60 parsecs from the center of the association and could have reached that separation in about 7±2 million years—which roughly agrees with estimated age of the association.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1#cite_note-science300_5622_1119-10">[10]</a></sup>

            With a galactic latitude of 4° and galactic longitude 71°, this system lies inward along the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Arm">Orion Spur</a>, in which the Sun is located within the Milky Way, near where the spur approaches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina%E2%80%93Sagittarius_Arm">Sagittarius Arm</a>. Cygnus X-1 has been described as belonging to the Sagittarius Arm, though the structure of the Milky Way is not well established.

            Cygnus X-1 is the subject of a two-part song series by Canadian progressive rock band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)">Rush</a>. The first part, "Book I: The Voyage", is the last song on the 1977 album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Farewell_to_Kings"><i>A Farewell to Kings</i></a>. The second part, "Book II: Hemispheres", is the first song on the following 1978 album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispheres_(Rush_album)"><i>Hemispheres</i></a>. The lyrics describe an explorer aboard the spaceship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocinante"><i>Rocinante</i></a>, who travels to the black hole, believing that there may be something beyond it. As he moves closer, it becomes increasingly 
            difficult to control the ship, and he is eventually drawn in by the pull of gravity.
